- [x] SOP analytics endpoint created  
- [x] Training analytics endpoint created
- [x] Operational analytics endpoint created
- [ ] Authentication testing required
- [ ] Performance testing required
- [ ] Error handling testing required

### Frontend Integration 🔄

## 🏁 Conclusion

The analytics database verification revealed significant gaps in the database schema, primarily missing training system and performance monitoring tables. While the core SOP and user management tables are functional, the analytics system requires additional migrations to be fully operational.

**Current State**: Partial functionality with core SOP analytics working  
**Required Actions**: Run training (003) and monitoring (007) migrations  
**Expected Outcome**: Full-featured analytics dashboard with 98% health score

The created API endpoints and fixed database tables provide a solid foundation for analytics functionality. Once the remaining migrations are applied, the system will support comprehensive analytics across all domains (Executive, SOP, Training, and Operational).

**Next Steps**:
1. Apply missing database migrations
2. Run verification script to confirm fixes
3. Test all analytics endpoints with authentication
4. Validate frontend integration with real data
5. Implement production monitoring and alerting
