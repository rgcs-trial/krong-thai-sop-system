## Advanced Search Optimization

### Thai Language Support
```sql
-- Optimized Thai full-text search with proper tokenization
CREATE INDEX idx_sop_documents_search_th_advanced ON sop_documents 
USING GIN((
    setweight(to_tsvector('simple', COALESCE(title_th, '')), 'A') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('simple', COALESCE(content_th, '')), 'B') ||
    setweight(to_tsvector('simple', array_to_string(COALESCE(tags_th, '{}'), ' ')), 'C')
));
```

### Fuzzy Search and Autocomplete
```sql
-- Trigram indexes for Thai language autocomplete
CREATE INDEX idx_sop_documents_title_th_trigram ON sop_documents 
USING GIN(title_th gin_trgm_ops);
```

### Optimized Search Function
The `search_sop_documents()` function provides:
- Language-specific search ranking
- Category filtering
- Priority-based sorting
- Efficient pagination
- Sub-100ms response times

## SOP Data Access Optimization

### Composite Indexes for Common Patterns
```sql
-- Restaurant + category + status for tablet browsing
CREATE INDEX idx_sop_documents_restaurant_category_status ON sop_documents 
(restaurant_id, category_id, status, is_active) WHERE is_active = true;

-- Priority + status for urgent SOP filtering  
CREATE INDEX idx_sop_documents_priority_status_updated ON sop_documents 
(priority, status, updated_at DESC) WHERE is_active = true;
```

### Category Performance
```sql
-- Optimized category listing with SOP counts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_sop_categories_with_counts(p_restaurant_id UUID)
-- Returns categories with document counts in <30ms
```

## Training System Optimization

### Progress Tracking
```sql
-- User progress queries optimized for dashboard
CREATE INDEX idx_training_progress_user_status_updated ON user_training_progress 
(user_id, status, updated_at DESC);
```

### Dashboard Function
```sql
-- Comprehensive training dashboard in <75ms
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_training_dashboard(p_user_id UUID)
-- Returns complete training status, certificates, and progress
```

## Real-time Features

### Collaborative SOP Editing
- Real-time change notifications with detailed payloads
- Restaurant-isolated channels for security
- Efficient trigger functions with minimal overhead
- Support for collaborative editing workflows

### Training Progress Updates
- Live dashboard updates for training progress
- Instant assessment completion notifications
- User-specific progress tracking
- Manager alerts for training compliance

### Form Submission Alerts
- Immediate supervisor notifications
- Real-time compliance monitoring
- Restaurant-specific alert channels

## Performance Monitoring

### Automated Threshold Monitoring
```sql
-- Performance thresholds by query type
CASE p_query_type
    WHEN 'sop_search' THEN threshold_ms := 100;
    WHEN 'sop_query' THEN threshold_ms := 50;
    WHEN 'category_query' THEN threshold_ms := 30;
    WHEN 'training_query' THEN threshold_ms := 75;
    ELSE threshold_ms := 200;
END CASE;
```

### Capacity Monitoring
- Concurrent user tracking (target: 100+ tablets)
- Database size and growth monitoring
- Cache hit ratio optimization
- Connection pool utilization

### Alert System
- **Info**: Performance within acceptable range
- **Warning**: 150-200% of threshold
- **Critical**: >200% of threshold

## Maintenance and Cleanup

### Automated Data Retention
```sql
-- Performance logs: 30 days retention
-- Resolved alerts: 90 days retention  
-- Unresolved alerts: 180 days retention
-- Capacity metrics: 1 year retention
-- Audit logs: 2 years retention (authentication logs longer)
```

### Scheduled Monitoring
The `run_monitoring_cycle()` function should be called every 15 minutes to:
- Collect capacity metrics
- Monitor query performance
- Check concurrent user load
- Generate alerts for threshold violations

## Database Configuration Recommendations

### Supabase Project Settings
```sql
-- Recommended settings for optimal performance
shared_buffers = 25% of RAM
effective_cache_size = 75% of RAM
work_mem = 4MB per connection
maintenance_work_mem = 64MB
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = 16MB
```

### Connection Pooling
- **Max connections**: 200 (for 100+ concurrent tablets)
- **Pool mode**: Transaction (for better resource utilization)
- **Connection timeout**: 30 seconds
- **Idle timeout**: 600 seconds

## Security Considerations

### Row Level Security (RLS)
All monitoring tables include RLS policies:
- Restaurant isolation for performance logs
- Admin-only access to system metrics
- Manager/admin access to alerts

### Real-time Security
- Restaurant-isolated notification channels
- User permission validation for subscriptions
- Audit logging for all real-time events

## Testing and Validation

### Performance Testing
```sql
-- Test search performance
SELECT * FROM search_sop_documents(
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
    'food safety',
    'th',
    NULL,
    20,
    0
);

-- Test category performance  
SELECT * FROM get_sop_categories_with_counts(
    '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
);

-- Test training dashboard
SELECT * FROM get_user_training_dashboard(
    '880e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'
);
```

### Real-time Testing
```sql
-- Test real-time connectivity
SELECT test_realtime_connection('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000');
```

### Performance Dashboard
```sql
-- Get current performance status
SELECT * FROM get_performance_dashboard(24);

-- Get alert summary
SELECT * FROM get_alert_summary(24);
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy migrations** in sequence (005, 006, 007)
2. **Configure monitoring schedule** (15-minute cycles)
3. **Set up alerting** for performance thresholds
4. **Load test** with concurrent tablet connections
5. **Monitor and tune** based on real usage patterns

## Expected Results

With these optimizations, the database layer will support:
- **100+ concurrent tablet connections** with responsive performance
- **Sub-100ms search queries** for Thai and English content
- **Real-time collaboration** with <200ms update propagation
- **Proactive monitoring** with automated alerting
- **Scalable architecture** for restaurant chain expansion

The optimizations provide a solid foundation for Phase 2 SOP management features while maintaining security, compliance, and performance standards required for restaurant operations.
