```

**Everything else in the hook should remain EXACTLY the same - all the sophisticated error handling, process management, cleanup functions, git logic, and safety mechanisms are perfectly engineered and shouldn't be modified.**

## 5. Project Integration Requirements

**Customize all agents and hooks for:**
- **Tech Stack**: [Your specific versions and tools]
- **Domain Context**: [Your business domain and specific requirements]
- **Team Structure**: [Your roles and responsibilities]
- **Development Workflow**: [Your Git/CI/CD patterns]
- **Quality Standards**: [Your code standards and review processes]
- **Security Requirements**: [Your compliance and security needs]
- **Performance Goals**: [Your optimization targets]
- **User Experience**: [Your UX/accessibility requirements]

**Each agent should understand:**
- Your project's file structure and naming conventions
- Your brand guidelines and design systems
- Your performance requirements and constraints  
- Your deployment and build processes
- Your testing strategies and frameworks
- Your documentation standards and audience
- Your domain-specific workflows and terminology

**For example customization:**
- **E-commerce project**: Replace "restaurant SOP management" with "e-commerce platform", examples like "feat(cart): implement checkout flow with Stripe integration"
- **CRM system**: Replace with "customer relationship management", examples like "feat(contacts): implement lead scoring with machine learning"
- **Blog platform**: Replace with "content management system", examples like "feat(editor): implement rich text editing with markdown support"

**The rest of the .claude setup (agents, commands, settings) follows the same pattern - keep the sophisticated structure and logic, just customize the domain-specific content and examples.**

**Make this production-ready with comprehensive error handling, security considerations, and clear usage instructions for each component.**"

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this template** to your new project directory
2. **Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] values** with your specific project details
3. **Customize the agent descriptions** with your domain expertise
4. **Adapt the commit hook examples** to your project's conventions
5. **Set appropriate permissions** in settings.local.json for your tech stack
6. **Test the setup** before relying on it in production

This template preserves the sophisticated automation and specialization of the original Krong Thai setup while being adaptable to any project domain and technology stack.
