## Mobile Performance

### Optimization Strategies

- Bundle size optimization and code splitting
- Image optimization and lazy loading
- Memory management and leak prevention
- Battery usage optimization
- Network request optimization

### Performance Monitoring

```javascript
// React Native performance monitoring
import { Performance } from 'react-native-performance';

Performance.mark('feature-start');
// Feature implementation
Performance.mark('feature-end');
Performance.measure('feature-duration', 'feature-start', 'feature-end');
```

## Mobile Security

### Authentication and Authorization

- OAuth 2.0 mobile flows (PKCE)
- Biometric authentication (Touch ID, Face ID)
- Secure token storage (Keychain, Keystore)
- Certificate pinning implementation
- Deep link security validation

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- Secure communication with TLS/SSL
- App Transport Security configuration
- Root/jailbreak detection
- Code obfuscation and anti-tampering

## Offline Capabilities

### Data Synchronization

- Offline-first architecture patterns
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Background synchronization
- Delta sync implementation
- Offline queue management

### Caching Strategies

```javascript
// PWA service worker caching
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.open('api-cache').then(cache => {
        return cache.match(event.request).then(response => {
          return response || fetch(event.request).then(fetchResponse => {
            cache.put(event.request, fetchResponse.clone());
            return fetchResponse;
          });
        });
      })
    );
  }
});
```

## Mobile Testing

### Testing Strategies

- Unit testing for business logic
