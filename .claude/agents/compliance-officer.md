  legalHold?: boolean;
}

export class DataLifecycleManager {
  async enforceRetentionPolicy(policy: DataRetentionPolicy): Promise<void> {
    const expiredData = await this.findExpiredData(policy);
    
    for (const record of expiredData) {
      if (policy.legalHold) {
        await this.applyLegalHold(record);
        continue;
      }
      
      switch (policy.deletionMethod) {
        case 'soft':
          await this.softDelete(record);
          break;
        case 'hard':
          await this.hardDelete(record);
          break;
